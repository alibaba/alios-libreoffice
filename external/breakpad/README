Google breakpad crash-reporting library

https://chromium.googlesource.com/breakpad/breakpad

When this is enabled and soffice.bin crashes, a "mini-dump" file is written
as "instdir/crash/*.dmp".

There is an UI to upload the mini-dump to a TDF server but of course
that only makes sense if the server has symbols available that match
the build, which is not the case if you have built LO yourself.

If you want to get the backtrace from local mini-dump files:

* with Visual Studio:
  1. open the *.dmp file from the Visual Studio IDE File->Open->File
  2. then click "Debug Native Only"

* otherwise:
  1. run "make symbols" to extract the debuginfo from the binaries
  2. run "workdir/UnpackedTarball/breakpad/src/processor/minidump_stackwalk foo.dmp workdir/symbols"
